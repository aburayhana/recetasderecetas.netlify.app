Hey everyone, it is me, Dave, welcome to my recipe page. Today, we're going to prepare a special dish, frappuccino. One of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I am going to make it a little bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

Frappuccino is a trademarked brand of the Starbucks Corporation for a line of iced, blended coffee drinks. It consists of coffee or crème base, blended with ice and other various ingredients like flavored syrups, usually topped with whipped cream and or spices. To make Vanilla Frappuccino: Add coffee, milk, sweetened condensed milk, and vanilla to a blender. Top off blender with ice and blend until smooth and icy. (Add half-and-half if you&#39;d like it to be a little richer and creamier.) Serve in a glass with whipped cream on top.
