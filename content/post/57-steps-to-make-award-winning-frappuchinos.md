It is unclear whether frappe is taken from frappé, a Greek iced coffee, or from the Boston area term for a thick milkshake frappe (pronounced &#34;frap&#34;), both of which come from the French word frappé.

T Frappuccinos are the ultimate Starbucks indulgence. They are full of calories and they also cost a fortune (for something that is mostly ice!!) BUT, when you make them at home, you can control the calorie content and they are far more cost effective. Make a simple frappuccino using a bottled frappuccino. But a bottle of unblended frappuccino; you can find it at Starbucks and well-stocked grocery stores.
