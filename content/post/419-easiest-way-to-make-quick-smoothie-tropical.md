The Greater Wilmington Business Journal spoke with Brandon Korman, owner of three area Tropical Smoothie Cafe locations, about weathering the pandemic and the brand&#39;s seasonal promotions. Korman: &#34;It has certainly been a major adjustment for us. Tropical Smoothie Cafe &#39;s menu boasts bold, flavorful smoothies - like the Island Green¬Æ and Sunrise Sunset‚Ñ¢ - with a healthy appeal, all made-to-order with quality ingredients. We find that real fruits, veggies and juices just taste better. Almond milk is great for the added nutty flavor, but coconut milk pairs well with a tropical smoothie and gives a richer, creamier flavor.
