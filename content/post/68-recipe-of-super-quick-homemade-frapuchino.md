##### The ingredients needed to make Frapuchino 🤤👌🏼✨:

1. Take 1 taza Hielo
1. Take 1 taza leche

Frozen Blended Coffee from Starbucks®, contains coffee concentrate, milk, ice and whatever desired flavor. the word &#34;frappuccino®&#34; is copywrited exclusively by starbucks®, probably put together from the words &#39;frozen&#39; and &#39;cappuccino&#39;. many other coffee companies, and even Dairy Queen® have there own version of this drink. I love Starbucks frappuccinos, but can&#39;t afford to go there every day.this is a better, cheaper alternative! Thanks to my dad&#39;s coffee addiction, my family usually makes at least three stops at Starbucks every day. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t have much of a taste for coffee, so I generally get a cream Frappuccino or a Frappucino with enough sugar to mask the taste of coffee.

There are a couple of ways to make a frappuccino, and each one allows you to. First, add in the ice in a blender.
